# Repository Purpose

This repository focuses on building the HTML document structure of a single-page personal/portfolio-style UI layout.

The goal of this project is not styling or interactivity, but to:

- Practice semantic HTML5 structure

- Break the webpage into logical sections (Header, Main, Footer)

- Understand how real-world website layouts are organized in HTML
