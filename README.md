# Repository Purpose

This repository focuses on building the HTML document structure of a single-page personal/portfolio-style UI layout.

The goal of this project is not styling or interactivity, but to:

- Practice semantic HTML5 structure

- Break the webpage into logical sections (Header, Main, Footer)

- Understand how real-world website layouts are organized in HTML


## What This Repository Contains

- A complete HTML skeleton of the webpage

- Proper use of semantic tags such as:

  - `<header>`

  - `<nav>`

  - `<main>`

  - `<section>`

  - `<footer>`

- Placeholder content for:

  - Logo / Name

  - Navigation icons

  - Hero section (intro text + button)

  - Image section
> **Note**:   
>No CSS or JavaScript is included.    
This repository is strictly about HTML structure.
